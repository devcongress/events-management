## 2026-05-29 — Softer admin UI polish

- Reduced hard-edged admin chrome with softer shared panels, controls, tabs, and inputs.
- Removed terminal-style event status decoration from the admin event overview.
- Softened quick action cards and top navigation while keeping the editorial DevCon-Comm identity.
- Simplified the event overview so tabs stay in a consistent position across Overview/Talks/Speakers and the overview no longer repeats navigation as cards.

## 2026-05-29 — Kahoot-from-paper prototype

- Added an admin-only PDF upload endpoint for quiz sessions that validates PDF type/size, extracts text locally, and appends rule-based draft questions to the existing quiz flow.
- Added Quiz Builder UI for uploading a paper/resource PDF, choosing draft count, viewing generation status, and editing generated questions before opening the lobby.
- Added local PDF extraction dependency and documented the new quiz-generation API surface.

## 2026-05-29 — Community product hardening

- Reframed the Vue landing page as a community hub with CFP/live quiz actions, recent published talks, and top members.
- Added archive search and filters across event text, talk titles, topics, and speakers.
- Improved speaker slide workflow with visible deadlines, upload state, and organizer reminder logging.
- Added local QR-code generation to the live quiz lobby.
- Updated reputation tracking so new quiz participation increments event counts and answers add to user totals.
- Added all-time/monthly leaderboard modes and claimed-profile badges.
- Added same-origin prototype admin cookie auth with `/admin/login`, route redirects, logout, and server-side guards for organizer mutations.
- Added planning/status files for the autonomous community-product pass.

## 2026-05-29 — Stack migration foundation

- Added Satoshi + IBM Plex Mono typography direction and removed the old Lato/JetBrains Mono pairing.
- Introduced editorial UI primitives for page headers, panels, labels, inputs, and actions.
- Made top navigation role-aware and added event-level admin tabs for Overview/Talks/Speakers/Quiz/Live.
- Refined major public/admin surfaces toward a more cohesive editorial tech-conference look.
- Switched package management from npm lockfile to pnpm and added `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Added Vue 3 + Vite app shell under `src/` and restored the DEV::CON[] branded landing page with Lato/JetBrains Mono fonts.
- Added Hono API app and Bun production server under `server/` so the UI and `/api/*` run on one same-origin port.
- Ported public Vue routes for archive, event talks, leaderboard, CFP, My Talks, quiz join, and live player gameplay.
- Ported admin Vue routes for event management, event status, talks, speakers, quiz builder, and live quiz controls.
- Added matching Hono endpoints for event CRUD, speaker allowlists, CFP, talks/slides, leaderboard/account tools, quiz sessions/questions, join/state/answer.
- Updated TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, and docs for the new migration target while keeping the legacy Next implementation as reference.

## 2026-05-01 — Docs sync to current app/api surface

- Updated architecture docs with current public/admin route inventory and complete API route list.
- Updated implementation docs to reflect active route-to-module mappings for CFP, speakers, talks/slides, and quiz workflows.
- Corrected API contract examples to current snake_case payloads (`/api/cfp`, `/api/quiz/join`, `/api/quiz/answer`).
- Added missing major endpoint coverage in docs: speaker management endpoints, quiz question `PATCH`/`DELETE`/`reorder`, and `/api/talks/[talkId]/upload`.

## 2026-03-23 — Initial index

- First scan of codebase; generated all 5 docs
- Project: DevCon-Comm (Next.js 14, JSON mock DB, quiz system)
