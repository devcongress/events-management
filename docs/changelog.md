## 2026-05-29 — Stack migration foundation

- Added Satoshi + IBM Plex Mono typography direction and removed the old Lato/JetBrains Mono pairing.
- Introduced editorial UI primitives for page headers, panels, labels, inputs, and actions.
- Made top navigation role-aware and added event-level admin tabs for Overview/Talks/Speakers/Quiz/Live.
- Refined major public/admin surfaces toward a more cohesive editorial tech-conference look.
- Switched package management from npm lockfile to pnpm and added `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Added Vue 3 + Vite app shell under `src/` and restored the DEV::CON[] branded landing page with Lato/JetBrains Mono fonts.
- Added Hono API app and Bun production server under `server/` so the UI and `/api/*` run on one same-origin port.
- Ported public Vue routes for archive, event talks, leaderboard, CFP, My Talks, quiz join, and live player gameplay.
- Ported admin Vue routes for event management, event status, talks, speakers, quiz builder, and live quiz controls.
- Added matching Hono endpoints for event CRUD, speaker allowlists, CFP, talks/slides, leaderboard/account tools, quiz sessions/questions, join/state/answer.
- Updated TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, and docs for the new migration target while keeping the legacy Next implementation as reference.

## 2026-05-01 — Docs sync to current app/api surface

- Updated architecture docs with current public/admin route inventory and complete API route list.
- Updated implementation docs to reflect active route-to-module mappings for CFP, speakers, talks/slides, and quiz workflows.
- Corrected API contract examples to current snake_case payloads (`/api/cfp`, `/api/quiz/join`, `/api/quiz/answer`).
- Added missing major endpoint coverage in docs: speaker management endpoints, quiz question `PATCH`/`DELETE`/`reorder`, and `/api/talks/[talkId]/upload`.

## 2026-03-23 — Initial index

- First scan of codebase; generated all 5 docs
- Project: DevCon-Comm (Next.js 14, JSON mock DB, quiz system)
